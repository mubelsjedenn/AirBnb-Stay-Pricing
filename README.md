# AirBnb-Stay-Pricing
In this project i have developed a machine learning model for predicting the price of AirBnb stays using regression.
Used a multitude of machine learning models for regression to select the best model for the job.
Usage of Pipelines to transform  the data for Linear and non-Parametric models.
As Linear models require the data the to be normalised and Non-Parametric models do better without normalization, it was imperative that there
were two different datasets one for linear models and the other  for non-Parametric models.

Models used:

1) Decision Tree Models

  a) Decision Tree Regression
  
  b) Random Forrest Regressor
  
  c)Gradient Boosted Regression 
  
2)Linear Models:

  a) Lasso regression
  
  b) Ridge regression
  
  c) ElasticNet regression
  
  d) Support Vector regression

Hyper parameter optimization using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
Cross validation using K-fold validation and visualization of metrics.
